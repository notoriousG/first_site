  <h1>A bit about the internet</h1>

  <h2>URL</h2>

  <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It contains several parts, including: the protocol: e.g. http, ftp the host: e.g. wwww.facebook.com, wwww.bbc.co.uk the path: e.g. /news/local,/john.smith.95</p>

  <h2>DNS/h2>

  <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, Go Daddy). The arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNA server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over hte entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update on another using a 'gossiping' mechanism. </p>

  <h2>Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</h2>

  <p>You can write comments in your html code, which won't be displayed in the browser.</p>

  <!--- This is a comment. It won't show up in the page, but you will be able to see it if you view the page source (be warned!) -->


  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>Html has two basic types of list:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) - displays a numbered list</li>
    <li>Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) - displays a list of bullet points</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Both have the same basic structure.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An opening list tag</li>
    <li>Many list items (&lt;li&gt;)</li>
    <li>A closing list tags</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./example.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
  <img src="./local_image.png" alt="A local image">

  <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>

  <h2>Tables</h2>
  <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>
  <table class='table'>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>College</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tom</td>
      <td>Oriel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dave</td>
      <td>Hertford</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
